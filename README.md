# Budget Buddy Client

This app is intended to be used to track your bills and visually display what days of the month they will occur on.  

You will be able to go to past and future months to see how your bills fall on a weekly/monthly basis.

There will be a sum section that will sum all of your bills and show the difference between your income, whether it is on a monthly, biweekly, or weekly basis.
